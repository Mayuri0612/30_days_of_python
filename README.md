# 30_days_of_python

This repository consists of programs covering the concepts of python from basics to advanced.

I took this course from youtube for self learning purpose. 

Python is a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, 
Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.

So I feel having a core knowledge of this programming language is a must. 

Each file/folder will be uploaded in a sequence from day1 to day28(approx). Along with that i'll be uploading some notes(text file) or will be writing it in readme section, if required.

Other than that I'll also be uploading some other python programs related to data structure other some other basic concepts, explicitly, which will give more clarity  about that particular topic.

For more infomation about the series, or any doubts regarding any concept or part of code, contact me at - kishoremayuri65@gmail.com

### Happy Coding!!
